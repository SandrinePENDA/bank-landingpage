## My process 👋

-Step-1: setting up the project environment (files/folder in mys VS Code editor, GitHub repository, ...).

Step-2: initial commit to ensure that the connection between my VS Code and GitHub is working well by pushing all assets to the distant repository.

Step-3: **let's coding :) 🚀** with Mobile First approach.
